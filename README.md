# zinit-annex-man

A Zsh-Zinit extension (i.e. an
[annex](https://zdharma-continuum.github.io/zinit/wiki/Annexes/)) that
automatically generates:

  - man pages for all plugins and snippets (out of plugin README.md files by
    using [ronn](https://github.com/rtomayko/ronn) converter),
  - code-documentation manpages (by using
    [zshelldoc](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zshelldoc) project).

Man extension is being activated at clone of a plugin and also at update of it
and it then generates the manpages. To view them there's a `zman` command:

```zsh
# View README.md manpage in the terminal
zman zinit-annex-man
# View the code documentation (via the full plugin name, as demonstrated)
zman -c zdharma-continuum/zinit-annex-man
```
